            <p>Rick and Morty is an adult animated science fiction sitcom created by Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon for Adult Swim. The series follows the misadventures of cynical mad scientist <em>Rick Sanchez</em> and his good-hearted but fretful grandson <em>Morty Smith</em>, who split their time between domestic life and interdimensional adventures.</p>
            <p>Rick is an eccentric and alcoholic mad scientist, who eschews many ordinary conventions such as school, marriage, love, and family. He frequently goes on adventures with his 14-year-old grandson, Morty, a kind-hearted but easily distressed boy, whose na√Øve but grounded moral compass plays counterpoint to Rick's Machiavellian ego. Morty's 17-year-old sister, Summer, is a more conventional teenager who worries about improving her status among her peers and sometimes follows Rick and Morty on their adventures. The kids' mother, Beth, is a generally level-headed person and assertive force in the household, though self-conscious about her professional role as a horse surgeon. She is dissatisfied with her marriage to Jerry, a simple-minded and insecure person, who disapproves of Rick's influence over his family.</p>
